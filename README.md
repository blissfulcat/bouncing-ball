# bouncing-ball
This project features an algorithm that simulates a ball bouncing off floors and walls, incorporating basic physics principles like gravity, velocity, and collision response. The simulation realistically reflects how the ball behaves upon hitting surfaces, with adjustable parameters for physics effects.
